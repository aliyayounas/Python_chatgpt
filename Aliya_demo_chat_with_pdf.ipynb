ChatGPT cannot directly talk to external data. The solution is PDF GPT, which allows you to chat with an uploaded PDF file using GPT functionalities. The application breaks the document into smaller chunks and generates embeddings using a powerful Deep Averaging Network Encoder. A semantic search is performed on your query, and the top relevant chunks are used to generate a response.\n",
